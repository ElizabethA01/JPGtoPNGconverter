# JPGtoPNGconverter
Exercise from my Udemy 'Complete python developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery' course


# Description of Exercise
Create a python script that converts a JPG file to PNG file. 
The following are the step-by-step instructions of what I needed to do within the script. 

#grab first and second argument

#check if new/ exists, if not create

#loop through Pokedex, 

#convert images to png

#save to the new folder


#How it Works

Save your jpg images in the Pokedex folder.

Run the code in your terminal and the code will firstly check if a folder called 'new' exists, if not it will create a folder. 

It will convert the images to png image files, then save the png image files in a new folder located in the Pokedex folder whilst the original files are located in the Pokedex folder.
